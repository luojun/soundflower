Please generate project files according to @prompt.txt .

~~
Please create a git ignore file appropriate for this project.

~~
Please add visualization. Please consider keeping the visualization code in a separate package.

~~
Please actually do animation -- animated rendering of the environment dynamics, including the robotic arm's motion and the sound source motion. Maybe consider using Pygame?

~~
Currently the @agents/heuristic_agent.py implementation has the HeristicAgent holding a reference to the environment object, which is less than ideal. It needs that for the "run_episode" method. However, the run_episode method really belongs elsewhere. Suggestion: please refactor the code such that we have an "experiments" package under which methods such as run_episode could live. Similarly, the repetitive code in @demo.py @demo_pygame.py and @demo_visualization.py could be refactored into an Experiment class under the experiments package and thus greatly simplfied.
