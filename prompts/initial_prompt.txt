 I would like to create a simple simulation in Python that serves as an RL
 environment.
 
 The environment is 2D. There is no gravity, or we can think of the 2D
 environment as being flat on the ground without frictio with the ground. 
 
 A simple robotic arm is mounted at the center of a circle. It may have
 anywhere between 1 DOF to 3DOF. We can think of it as an arm with 1 to 3
 links, with the "shoulder" link pivoting around the center of the circle.
 At the other tip of the arm is mounted an array of microphones. For now,
 we can assume that there is only a single mic. (In future versions, there
 will likely be multiple mics forming an array.)
 
 This makes the whole thing a "sound flower" in that the agent will be
 incentivized to track the sound source. For example, the RL reward could 
 be tied to the level of sound energy being picked up by the microphone
 array, such as the *delta* or the time derivative of sound energy at the
 mic array.
 
 Along the circle could appear a single sound source. In future versions,
 multiple sound sources could appear in principle anywhere on the 2D plane
 and being moving, as if at a cocktail party.

 The arm with all its links fully extended may or may not be able to reach
 the circumference of the circle or the rim of the circular disk.
 Additionally, the circle's radius could vary. Sometimes the radius is
 shorter than the total arm length and sometimes longer.
 
 The arm will be driven at the joints between two links and in the case of
 the shoulder joint, between the shoulder link or "upper arm" and the
 pivoting point "on the ground". The joints all offer limitless turning in
 both direction. But there is friction at the joints. And joint friction
 could vary within a reasonable range with a "frozen joint" being possible.
 The joints are controlled with torque. And the links have mass that could
 also vary individually and independently. For simplicity, we can assume
 that the mass is concentrated at the midpoint of a link. For simplicity,
 we do not need to care about the self-collision of the arm, as if each link
 occupies its own plane.

 In sum, the design need to (1) accommodate the many kinds of variations
 with "knobs" for changing these appropriately exposed with reasonable
 default values and default dynamics: number of links, link length,
 friction at joints, number of microphones,
 number, position and motion of sound sources, as well as possibly gain
 of microphones and strength of sound sources, and even the coefficient
 of sound attenuation over distance (for the inverse square law) etc; and
 (2) differentiate the environment and the agent clearly and link them
 together with a well designed and crucially asynchronoous interface,
 unlike OpenAI Gym's synchronous interface.   
 
 Please write Python code to generate such a simulated RL environment,
 please implement a simple heuristic, i.e. unlearning, agent, and run
 the agent and the environment together as an integrated demo.
