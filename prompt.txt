 I would like to create a simple simulation. The environment is 2D. A simple robotic arm is mounted at the center of a circle. It may have anywhere between 1 DOF to 3DOF. We can think of it as an arm with 1 to 3 links, with the "shoulder" link pivot around the center of the circle. At the other tip of the arm is mounted a speaker or a light sensor. This makes the whole thing a "sound flower" or "sunflower". Along the circle could appear either a sound source or a light source. The arm with all its links fully extended may or may not be able to reach the circle or the rim of the circular disk. Alternatively, we can think of the circle as having potentially various radius, somethings the radius shorter than the total arm length and somethings longer. The arm will be driven at the joints between two links and in the case of the shoulder joint, between the shoulder link or "upper arm" and the pivoting point "on the ground". There is no gravity, or we can think of the 2D environment as being flat on the ground. The joints all offer limitless turning in both direction. But there is friction at the joints. The joints are controlled with torque. Thus the links have mass. For simplicity, we can assume that the mass is concentrated at the midpoint of a link. Please write code to generate such a simulation environment, and run it as a demo. 

Please implement it in Python.
